# Material Shrinkage and Extrusion Multiplier Tuning
The final dimensions of a printed part are affected primarily by the XY motion system, the material shrinkage and extrusion width. We've already calibrated the XY motion in [XY Differential Calibration](xy-differential-calibration.md), here we will treat the other two sources of error to hopefully produce repeatedly dimensionally accurate parts.

## Why This Calibration?
Conventional material shrinkage calibration methods directly derive the scale factors from measuring a reference object, inadvertently incorporating errors like extrusion width and measurement biases. Such approaches, conflate material shrinkage with unrelated additive errors, leading to imprecise results.

Our method uses differential measurements, akin to [XY Differential Calibration](xy-differential-calibration.md), isolating material shrinkage by cancelling out additive errors. This results in an accurate scale factor for shrinkage alone.

For extrusion multiplier calibration, traditional techniques measure extruded width post-shrinkage. This causes more material to be extruded than the slicer requested.

We compensate the measured extrusion width by the above shrinkage factor to make sure that the actually extruded amount of material is as intended.

The details and proofs are in the [paper](shrinkage-and-multiplier-calibration.pdf).

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have:
- Completed the [XY Differential Calibration](xy-differential-calibration.md).
- Accurately [calibrated your extruder's `rotation_distance`](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/articles/extruder_calibration.html).
- Calibrated [pressure advance](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/articles/pressure_linear_advance/introduction.html) for the filament, with a slight overestimate to prevent corner bulging.
- Familiarized yourself with the "Material Calibration" tab in the [calibration spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12_Dv7_rYfVe8zgUhWrPeNcvSJCttsugQXTOSlCp6MAc).
- Performed temperature and stringing tuning as temperature changes post-calibration can affect shrinkage.
- Access to precise measurement tools:
    * 150 mm digital calipers are required for the shrinkage calibration.
    * A micrometer is required for the extrusion width calibration presented here (Â±0.1% accuracy for extrusion widths around 0.5 mm). If a micrometer is unavailable, consider [alternative calibration methods](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/articles/extrusion_multiplier.html), noting potential impacts on precision.

## Measuring Tips
Measure 5 times, taking care to remove the calipers each time. Discard and re-measure any outliers, take the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) of the measured values as the value to enter into the spreadsheet.

Note that the [XY Reference Dimensions.stl](stl/XY%20Reference%20Dimensions.stl) model has "tabs" that allow you to easily align the jaws of the calipers by pressing the tab against the neck of the calipers, as shown below for repeatable measurements:

### When Should You Re-Do the Calibration?
- Initiating a new filament profile.
- Any change to the extruder's `rotation_distance`.
- Adjustments to nozzle temperature settings due to their effect on material shrinkage.

## Calibration Procedure 
This procedure unfolds in two critical steps: First, we determine the material's shrinkage factor to scale the model pre-printing. Then, we calculate the extrusion multiplier, which hinges on the established shrinkage factor.

### Step 1: Material Shrinkage Calibration
1. Add a new filament entry in the calibration spreadsheet.
2. Print [XY Reference Dimensions.stl](stl/XY%20Reference%20Dimensions.stl) with the following settings:
    * Solid beams (high perimeter count).
    * External perimeters are printed first.
    * Layer height of 0.1 mm.
    * Reduced extrusion multiplier (by 5%).
    * Print speed: 60 mm/s, Acceleration: 800 mm/s^2.
3. Allow the model to cool on the build plate to room temperature.
4. Mark the X and Y axes.
5. Measure the 150 mm and 5 mm reference dimensions and record them in the spreadsheet. Refer to [Measuring Tips](#measuring-tips).

Input the calculated scale factors into your slicer or keep the spreadsheet around for future prints. If you're using  PrusaSlicer, consider upvoting the request for this feature [PrusaSlicer issue#4475](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/issues/4475).

Should the calibration yield notably inconsistent X and Y scale factors, revisit the steps to identify any discrepancies.

### Step 2: Extrusion Multiplier
1. Enter the current extrusion multiplier into the spreadsheet.
2. Print the [Extrusion Multiplier.stl](stl/Extrusion%20Multiplier.stl) with these settings:
    * Slightly increased pressure advance.
    * Wide extrusion width (150% nozzle diameter).
    * Thin layers (0.1 mm).
    * Vase mode.
    * Slow print speed and acceleration.
    * A brim to prevent warping.
3. Let the part cool, inspect for warping, then measure the wall thickness with a micrometer above the 8 notches, noting the values in the spreadsheet.

Update your slicer with the new extrusion multiplier from the spreadsheet.

### Step 3: Validate
1. Re-slice the [XY Reference Dimensions](stl/XY%20Reference%20Dimensions.stl) using the scale factor and new extrusion multiplier.
2. Print and measure again. Aim for reference dimensions within 0.02 mm of true values.

If dimensions are not satisfactory, review your technique and measurements, and if necessary, restart from step 1.

## After Calibration
Congratulations, your primary material parameters are now calibrated and your parts are hopefully accurate!

Next steps involve tuning secondary printing parameters such as perimeter overlap, bridging speeds, elephants foot compensation, etc.
